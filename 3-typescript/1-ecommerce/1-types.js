/**
 * Challenge 1: Type Definitions for Product Catalog
 *
 * You need to define proper TypeScript types for the product catalog data.
 * These types should accurately represent the structure of the JSON data and establish
 * the relationships between different entities (e.g., products and brands).
 *
 * The JSON data is provided in the `data` folder.
 *
 * Consider:
 * - Handle all of the properties in the JSON data as accurately as possible in typescript types
 * - Use appropriate types for each property (e.g., string, number, boolean, etc.)
 * - Optional properties and mandatory properties
 * - The use of union types for properties that can have multiple types
 * - The use of enums for properties that can have a limited set of values
 * - The use of interfaces and type aliases to create a clear and maintainable structure
