/*
  Challenge 2: Users Who Dislike More Movies Than They Like

  Get a list of users who have rated more movies negatively than positively.

  Use the methods in utils/mocked-api to retrieve user and rating data.
  Check how many movies each user liked and disliked, then return only those with more dislikes.

  Requirements:
  - Use only Promise static methods (e.g., Promise.all, Promise.then, etc.) to handle the results
  - Only print the user information in the output—no extra text or formatting

 * @property {number} age - The age of the user.

/**
 * Logs and returns the users who dislike more movies than they like.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<User[]>} A promise that resolves to an array of users who dislike more movies than they like.
